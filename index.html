            <br>
            <p>One of the most famous historical sites in India, the Taj Mahal of Agra dates back to the 17th century.
                It was built by Shah Jahan, the Mughal emperor, in the memory of Mumtaz Mahal, his third wife. It is
                also the abode of the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The Taj Mahal has intricate carvings and is made
                entirely of white marble, on the southern banks of the Yamuna River. It is also one of the Seven Wonders
                of the World. It took around 22 years to complete the construction of this splendid monument. The tomb
                is laid out in a rectangular shape and can be approached through a massive gateway which has an arch and
                alcoves on either side of it. There are water channels and fountains in the entrance which makes the
                monument even more spectacular.

            <p>Another relic of the British Raj in India, the Victoria Memorial is located in the heart of Kolkata, in
                West Bengal. This white marbled opulent structure was built in memory of Queen Victoria to celebrate her
                25 years of rule over India and is almost a replica of the Victoria Memorial in London. The memorial is
                surrounded by a lush green and well-maintained garden, which spreads over 64 acres and has numerous
                statues and sculptures in it. A sixteen-foot tall bronze statue of victory, mounted on ball bearings at
                the top of the memorial, serves to heighten the overall appeal and grandeur of the entire complex.
                Victoria Memorial is breathtaking and marvellous, especially at night, when it is illuminated.

            <h2>Konark Sun Temple, Odisha</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Situated on the northeastern corner of Puri. Built in the form of a giant rath or chariot of the Sun God,
                it depicts the chariot being pulled by a set of seven horses, four on the left side and three on the
                right. It has three deities dedicated to the Sun God on three different sides of the temple which catch
                the direct rays of sun in the morning, afternoon and evening. Konark Sun Temple is one of the last
                standing structures before the fifteenth century in the country. The sun rays reach the Nata Mandir from
                the coast and reflect through the diamond at the centre of the idol. The idol is believed to float
                mid-air due to arrangements of the magnets at the top of the temple but they were later removed due to
                the disturbance caused to coastal voyages.
